# Recogonize Flowers with TensorFLow Lite Model Maker and Android Studio ML Model Binding

This folder contains the code for the TensorFlow Lite codelab:

* [Recognize Flowers with TensorFlow on Android (Beta)](https://goo.gle/3dbCSbt)

## Introduction

This beta codelab introduces the latest tooling using TensorFlow Lite Model Maker and Android Studio 4.1 Beta 1 or above. In addition, it will require access to a physical Android device to test. If you prefer to use the stable version of this codelab, follow this codelab instead.

In these codelabs, you will learn:

*   How to train your own custom image classifier using [TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/tutorials/model_maker_image_classification).
*   How to use Android Studio to import the TensorFlow Lite model to integrate the custom model in an Android app using CameraX.
*   How to use GPU on your phone to accelerate your model.


## Pre-requisites

[Android Studio 4.1 Beta 1 or above](http://developers.android.com/studio/preview)

## Getting Started

Visit the Google codelabs site to follow along the guided steps.
